# React-Card-Hub

A new type of social network made with React. It uses Cards as tiny "apps". The browsers have gotten really powerfull in the last few year and combined with the power of React, you can create an entirily new type of social network. It uses Cards as tiny "apps". 

Acts as a hub for the browser.

Designed to consume information quickly.    

The intended aim is to put the entire mobile os in the browser. Unifying the power of both. Instead of having icons, you can display the entire app. 

Uses my CSS framework SunshineCSS

# Features

5 Color Schemes. The user can freely switch between the color schemes.  
-Ability to customize each app's color scheme.  

Multiple modes for cards
-When the user is not interacting with the card, it displays a different ui, like a screensaver. 


The app is fully responsive naturally. The cards act as individual screens on the mobile.Longpress to switch to the desktop layout with tinier cards with an icon in them, basically a card drawer.
